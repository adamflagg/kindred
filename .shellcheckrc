# Shellcheck configuration for Kindred project
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Default shell dialect
shell=bash

# Disabled checks:
# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source (expected for dynamic config loading)
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (may not exist in CI environment)
# SC2015: A && B || C is not if-then-else (intentional cleanup patterns)
# SC2034: Unused variables (common for color definitions, loop counters, config vars)
# SC2317: Command appears unreachable (false positive for trap handlers and eval-called functions)
disable=SC1090,SC1091,SC2015,SC2034,SC2317
