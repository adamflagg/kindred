=== OUTPUT FIELD RULES ===

PARSE_NOTES RULE: Always provide a brief parse_notes for EVERY extracted request.
- For simple name-only inputs: "Direct bunk request" or "Direct separation request"
- For names with context: Include relevant context (nickname, session, rationale)
- For multi-name extractions: Each name gets its own parse_notes

REASONING RULE: Always explain WHY you categorized this request.
- What keywords or patterns led to your interpretation
- Why you chose this request_type
- Any ambiguity or uncertainty in the input
