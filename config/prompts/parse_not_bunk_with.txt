You are parsing the "do_not_share_bunk_with" field for {camp_name},
a residential summer camp where campers live in overnight cabins ("bunks") with 8-12 campers.

=== SOURCE CONTEXT ===

This is STAFF-ENTERED content, summarized after conversations with parents or other staff insights.
Staff entries are typically:
- More structured and professional than raw parent input
- May include brief rationale in parentheses
- Sometimes include session-specific qualifiers
- May note flexibility ("if possible", "ideal but ok if not")
- Often contain just names with minimal context

{requester_info}

Field content: "{request_text}"

TASK: Extract ALL separation requests from this field. ALL requests are "not_bunk_with" type.

=== REQUEST TYPES ===

This field ONLY contains separation requests:

"not_bunk_with" - Camper should NOT share a cabin with specific person(s)
   target_name = person's name or "SIBLING"

IMPORTANT: Do NOT extract bunk_with or age_preference from this field.
Even if text mentions friendship ("still friends"), the intent is separation.

=== SPECIAL PLACEHOLDERS ===

Use "SIBLING" when the text references:
- Family members: twin, sister, brother, sibling
- Family names: "other Miller kids", "Miller twins"

=== FIELD-SPECIFIC PATTERNS ===

Example 1 - Simple name:
Input: "Maya Anderson"
Output: 1 not_bunk_with for "Maya Anderson"

Example 2 - Name with alternate/nickname:
Input: "Riley 'Alex' Cooper"
Output: 1 not_bunk_with for "Riley Cooper", parse_notes: "Also known as 'Alex'"

Example 3 - Name with parenthetical alternate:
Input: "Nico (Nicholas) Park"
Output: 1 not_bunk_with for "Nico Park", parse_notes: "Also known as Nicholas"

Example 4 - Multiple names with separators:
Input: "Chloe Bennett & Bella Torres"
Output: 2 not_bunk_with requests, one for each name

Example 5 - Name with staff rationale:
Input: "Emma Johnson (neg relationship together at hebrew school) - ok if together but Jordan call if so"
Output: 1 not_bunk_with for "Emma Johnson", parse_notes: "neg relationship at hebrew school; ok if together with staff call"

Example 6 - Session-specific qualifier:
Input: "Neg req Harper Collins in Ses 3"
Output: 1 not_bunk_with for "Harper Collins", parse_notes: "Session 3 specific"

Example 7 - Multiple with uncertainty markers:
Input: "Kai Williams (Ses 4), Daniel Garcia-Lopez (?) Ryan Murphy (Ses 2) Marco Silva (?)"
Output: 4 not_bunk_with requests, confidence lower for (?) entries, session info in parse_notes

Example 8 - Family reference:
Input: "Not with Lily Chen/other Miller kids if possible (they go to school together)"
Output: 2 not_bunk_with requests - "Lily Chen" and a second with target_name "SIBLING" for family reference

Example 9 - Flexibility note:
Input: "Isla Reyes-Kim, Leo Nakamura (ideal if all 3 are in separate cabins but ok if not)"
Output: 2 not_bunk_with requests with "flexibility noted" in parse_notes

Example 10 - Staff friendship note (still negative intent):
Input: "Sofia Petrov (mom understands that they will be together)"
Output: 1 not_bunk_with for "Sofia Petrov", parse_notes: "low priority - mom understands if bunked together"

=== TEMPORAL CONFLICTS ===

Temporal conflicts are rare in this field, but if present:

RULE: The EARLIER/FIRST request is SUPERSEDED. The LATER/CURRENT one survives.

Example: "Previously wanted separate from Mia, now ok to bunk together"
- Request 1: not_bunk_with "Mia", temporal_info: {{is_superseded: true}}
- Request 2: (no second request - the separation request was canceled)

=== INVALID TARGETS (DO NOT EXTRACT) ===

- Physical preferences: "Different unit than..." (unless a person name follows)
- Vague descriptions: "younger kids", "certain kids"
- Generic groups: "campers", "friends"
- The requester themselves

=== OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS ===

For each valid request, provide:
- request_type: "not_bunk_with" (always for this field)
- target_name: Person's name or "SIBLING"
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 (lower for (?) entries, uncertain names)
- temporal_info: null OR {{date_mentioned, is_superseded, supersedes_reason}}
- keywords_found: Priority words if present
- source_type: "staff" (always for this field)
- parse_notes: Include rationale, session qualifier, flexibility notes
- reasoning: Why you extracted this name
- list_position: Position in multi-name fields (0-indexed)
